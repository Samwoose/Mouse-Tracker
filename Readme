We modified mouse tracker program posted on YouTube and Github (Original link below) for our friend's research video input. 
So that the program can work with a different input video.

Major modification is summarized as follows. 
1.Input preprocessing
Dimension of preprocessed each frame has been modified because our input has a different frame dimension. 
e.g. 
from: frame = frame[:, w-h : w] #Original Preprocessed frame
to: frame = (255-frame[285:1080-270,695:1920-700]) #Modified Preprocess frame. 

Note: Since mouse in our video input is black, we need to invert the color of the mouse in each frame. 
This is why there is '255' term in the modified code. 
Furthermore, to make object tracking task easier, we manually found optimized dimension of frame that will be used during tracking.
e.g.frame[285:1080-270,695:1920-700] : chosen frame from a whole big frame which contains unusful information for the tracking task. 

2.Manual height of frame modification.
e.g. h=525

If you take a look at the original python script closely, we need to adjust variable 'h' whenever our proprocessing on each frame changes row dimension of the frame
because this h is utilized for cv2.warpPerspective(frame, perspectiveMatrix[name], (h,h))  (line 151). 
In our practice, we choose height (a.k.a 'h' ) as 525. 

3.Removal of background subtraction step.
Unlike the original script, we removed background subtraction step e.g. cv.subract(frame, background) (line 222). 
This is simply because we get a proper processed data for tracking task. This part will be needed to be modified for universal application. i.e., any video input
